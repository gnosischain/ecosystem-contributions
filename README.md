# Gnosis Builder Ideas ü¶â

Gnosis is evolving through its ambitious Gnosis 3.0 initiative, expanding its reach beyond traditional blockchain applications into a collective of interconnected projects. We are looking for builders to contribute to this growing ecosystem of innovative solutions focused on revolutionizing payments, decentralized financial tools, and blockchain infrastructure.

## Core Units of Gnosis to build in

### Hashi üåâ
Hashi is focused on improving bridge security between chains. As a foundational infrastructure, it ensures robust and secure interactions between Gnosis Chain and other blockchain networks.

### Gnosis Pay üí≥
Gnosis Pay is integrating Web3 with existing financial rails, aiming to eventually replace them with more efficient, blockchain-based solutions. This venture is pivotal in our push towards decentralized financial systems.

### Circles üîµ
Circles introduces a web-of-trust-based decentralized UBI system, designed to provide sustainable and scalable financial support within the community, leveraging blockchain technology for transparent and fair distribution.

### Gnosis Chain ‚õìÔ∏è
Gnosis Chain, a sister chain to Ethereum, focuses on scaling Ethereum through horizontal expansion. It plays a critical role in the infrastructure for deploying and managing decentralized applications.

## Project Ideas üß†

We have compiled a variety of project ideas that align with the Gnosis 3.0 vision across our core units: Hashi, Gnosis Pay, Circles, Gnosis Chain, and Metri. These ideas are accessible directly within this repository, under the **Issues** tab.

### Filtering and Selecting Ideas:
- **Browse by Tag:** Each idea is tagged with relevant project labels, making it easy to find opportunities that match your interests and expertise.
- **Assess Complexity and Required Skills:** Issues are also tagged with their complexity level and the skill sets needed, allowing you to choose projects that best fit your capability and growth ambitions.

### Contributing to an Idea:
1. **Choose an Idea:** Select an issue that aligns with your interests and skills.
2. **Claim an Idea:** To start working on an idea, comment on the issue expressing your intent to work on it. This helps prevent overlaps and ensures coordination within the community.
3. **Stay Updated:** Regularly check back for any updates or additional instructions from the project maintainers to ensure alignment with the project's goals.

We encourage you to dive into these ideas, innovate, and contribute to the Gnosis ecosystem. Each contribution helps us move closer to a decentralized and open financial future.
